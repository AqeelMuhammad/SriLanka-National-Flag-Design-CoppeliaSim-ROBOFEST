# Sri Lanka National Flag Design - CoppeliaSim - ROBOFEST 2021

## Introduction

* ROBOFEST 2021 is open to students from schools and universities. Students will be given a chance to participate in the competition by combining the practical application of science and technology with fun, intense energy, and excitement of a championship-sporting event.

* The Robot Simulator, [CoppeliaSim EDU](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) (Formerly known as V-rep) is used for the completion of the task. It is a software which is ideal for multi-robot application simulation and the controllers can be written in C/C++, Python, Java, Lua, Matlab or Octave.

* The controller for this task is written in [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
